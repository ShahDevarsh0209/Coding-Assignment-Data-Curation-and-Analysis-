Coronavirus Cases in Countries and Territories in January 2021

#### Project Goal

The aim of this project is to create a dataset about the number of coronavirus cases in January 2021, publish it to data.world, and analyze the dataset.

#### Source

I used the Wikipedia page titled "COVID-19 pandemic cases in January 2021" as my source.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_cases_in_January_2021


#### Potential Issues

The data is limited in the sense that some countries or territories could have chosen not to report their cases or report an inaccurate number of cases which would result in the data not being completely accurate. 


#### Analysis

Through data analysis, I observed an almost linear positive trend in the number of coronavirus cases worldwide in January 2021.


#### Project Summary

The project is an assignment for a data science class. The dataset that includes the Covid-19 pandemic cases in the month of January 2021 extracted from the Wikipedia page titled "COVID-19 pandemic cases in January 2021". It is a combination of the two tables on the page which include half of January each with certain rows such as "Days to Double" and "Countries and Territories" removed. Furthermore, the rows and columns from the intial table are inverted to help make the dataset more understandable and readable. The data collection and analysis is done in the IPYNB file.
